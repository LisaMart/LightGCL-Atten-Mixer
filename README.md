LightGCL model combined with AMGNN-SR (Atten-Mixer Enhanced Graph Neural Network for Session-based Recommendation).

📌 Problem 
Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for session-based next-item recommendation suffer from high computational cost due to deep message-passing layers, while still struggling to balance short-term dynamics and long-term intent, especially under sparse or noisy session data.

✅ Solution 
AMGNN-SR replaces heavy GNN propagation with a lightweight Atten-Mixer module — a multi-level attention-based readout that aggregates session semantics in linear time.
